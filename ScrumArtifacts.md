# Scrum Artifacts

## Product Backlog

### Definition

Indentify the Product Backlog as an ordered and emerging list of user needs plus anything else that is required to fulfill the Product Vision

### Contents

> Describe how the detail of the Product Backog items will be tied to their position or order and how the Product Backlog contents will change over time

> Describe how the Product Backlog will contain functional, non -functional, architectural and infrastructural elements as well as rsks that need to be removed or mitigated. Wherever possible, items on the Product Backlog will be in vertical slices

### Management and Refinement
> Identify the need for the PRdouct Backlog to be refined periodically in order for it to remain good e nough for the next level of planning. The whole Scrum Team can participate in the refinement of the Product Backlog

### Responsibility and Participation
> Identify why the Product Owner is ultimatel responsible for the content and state of the Product Backlog, though anyone is able and encouraged to contribute to the Product Backlog

### Item Readiness
> Describe that, in order for an item to be considered ready for inclusion in a Sprint each Product Backlog item should be small enough to fit into a Sprint and must be clear in the expectations of the Product Owner

### Item Estimation
> Describe that the Team is responsible for estimating the items on the Product Backlog and that this estimate should be made in the simplest, most consistent, and most realistic manner possible. Scrum does not require any specific estimation techniques

## Product increment and the definition of Done

### Definition of Product Increment
> Describe that, at the end of each Sprint the Product Owner should have the opportunity to realize value from the investment put in to date as an increment of functionality perceivable to the final user of the Product. (i.e. They could begin the deployment process for the work that has been done this Sprint, if they choose).

### Development of a Product Increment
> Identify that the Team will be developing every item from the Product Backlog with the view that this will be completed to a state of potentially shippable code.

### Definition of DONE
> Identify that Scrum's minimal DOD means potentially shippable. If the Team is using anything other than that minimal Dod, it should be explicitly captured

### Understanding the Dod
> Analyze the consequences of an inadequate DoD for the Team, the product, and the organization, and identify that any "undone" product backlog must be returned to the Product Backlog. Analyze the consequences of having a product in an "unstable/undefined" state due to accumulated "undone" work

## Sprint Backlog
### Definition
> Identify that the Sprint Backlog as the Team's plan for how it is going to turn the Product Backlog items selected for a Sprint into potentially shippable functionality

### Purpose
> Describe the Sprint Backlog's two main purposes: a detailed view of the Team's expected work for a Sprint and a tool for the Team to manage itself during the Sprint

### Management
> Define and describe at least one technique for managing the Sprint Backog

### Responsibility
> Describe the Responsibility of the Team for creating and maintaining the Sprint Backlog

### Update Scope
> Identify that the Sprint Backlog should, at all times, show what items are being worked on and by whom. Sometimes the Sprint Backlog should also show how much effort is still required to complete these items.

### Update Frequency
> Describe the need for the Team to update the Sprint Backog at least once a day

## Burndown Charts
> Describe the circumstances under which Burndown charts are useful

### Sprint Burndown Chart
#### Definition
> Define the Sprint Burndown as aa chart illustrating a comparison between the initial estimated amount of work at the Sprint Planning Meeting and the current estimated amount of work remaining

#### Purpose
> Describe how the Sprint Burndown chart is Primarily used by the teaam to manage themselves during the Sprint

#### Responsibility
> Describe that the ScrumMaster is responsible for ensuring that the Teama is aware of its Sprint burndown status and encouraging the Team to update the Sprint Burndown chart

#### Update Frequency
> Identify when the Sprint Burndown chart will typically be updated and describe the reason to do so

## Release Burndown Chart
### Definition
> Describe the release Burndown chart's use of empirical data and the estimations provided by the Team to indicate either the projected end date of the release or the projected amount of Product Backlog that will be completed

### Purpose
> Describe the Release Burndown chart's use as a tool for the Product Owner in order to manage the plan for the product release

### Responsibility
> Identify the Product Owner's responsibility to use the empirical data and estimations produced by the Team in each Sprint to udpate the Release burndown charat

### Update Frequency
> Identify when the Release Burndown chart will typically be updated and describe the reason to do so
