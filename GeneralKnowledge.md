Agile Manifesto
------------------
Define and describe the four values of Agile as stated in the Agile Manifesto


- Individuals and interactions over Process and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Scrum Foundations
------------------
*Empirical and defined Processes*
Define and describe the two terms, including a description of inspect, adapt and transparency as the three legs of an empirical process. 
Describe how the Scrum Framework is based on the empirical process.

### Empirical

Scrum is based in empirical process control theory. As the degree of complexity rises, the number of inspections must be increased. Because of the increased frequency
- Defined Processes
- Inspect
- Adapt
- Transparency

### Sprint
#### Interative and Incremental
#### Protected
#### Timeboxed
- Has a fixed duration. Is all of the available time for the task
- Shorter Sprint give faster feedback but with a higher cost of the process
- Long Sprint have less process overhead but also less response to change

### The Significance of Done
  Define the role of *done*, and  describe the importance of having a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint in order to optimize business value, mitigate risk and maximize transparency.

### The Five Scrum Values

Identify the five Scrum Values, and use examples of how Scrum Practices Support the application of each  

- **Focus** - “Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The sun’s rays do not burn until brought to a focus.” – Alexander Graham Bell
  
- **Courage** - “Fortes fortuna adiuvat – fortune favours the brave” – Latin proverb
  Finally the Team must have the courage to aggressively commit to as much work as they think they can do each sprint.

- **Openness** - “It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.” – Epictetus
  Transparency, problems are pushed to light and dealt with in an open environment.

- **Commitment** – “Do, or do not. There is no try.” – Master Yoda
  The Team commits to doing whatever is necessary in order to meet their goals.  
 
- **Respect** - "I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university.” – Albert Einstein
  Everyone on a scrum project needs to be aware that the PO is in charge of what the Team works on, but not how they do their work, and that the Team is responsible for getting the work done, but not questioning what work gets done.
