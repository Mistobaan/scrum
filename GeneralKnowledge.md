Scrum Foundations
------------------
*Empirical and defined Processes*
Define and describe the two terms, including a description of inspect, adapt and transparency as the three legs of an empirical process. 
Describe how the Scrum Framework is based on the empirical process.

- Empirical: Scrum is based in empirical process control theory. As the degree of complexity rises, the number of inspections must be increased. Because of the increased frequency
- Defined Processes
- Inspect
- Adapt
- Transparency

- Sprint
  a. Interative and Incremental
  b. Protected
  c. Timeboxed
     - Has a fixed duration. Is all of the available time for the task
     - Shorter Sprint give faster feedback but with a higher cost of the process
     - Long Sprint have less process overhead but also less response to change

- The Significance of Done
  Define the role of *done*, and  describe the importance of having a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint in order to optimize business value, mitigate risk and maximize transparency.

- The Five Scrum Values
  Identify the five Scrum Values, and use examples of how Scrum Practices Support the application of each
